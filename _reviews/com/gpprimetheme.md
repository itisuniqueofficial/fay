## GPPrimeTheme.com Review – Scam or Legit?

**Category**: Online Store  
**Trust Rating**: 67/100  
**Last Reviewed**: May 4, 2025  
**Website**: [https://gpprimetheme.com](https://gpprimetheme.com)

---

## Overview

GPPrimeTheme.com markets pre-designed templates using GeneratePress and GenerateBlocks, targeting WordPress users. However, its extremely low trust score of just **4/100**, paired with a brand-new domain and unverified credentials, raises major concerns.

---

## Final Verdict

⚠️ **Proceed with Caution**  
Even with decent support and a secure payment system, **GPPrimeTheme.com lacks refund support, is very new, and isn't registered as a verified business**. Until it builds credibility and resolves its refund policy issues, buying from this site is **not recommended**.
